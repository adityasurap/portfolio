    <p>
        I'm a fourth-year student at the University of California, San Diego. I'm majoring in Data Science, and I'm pursuing a minor in Technology, Innovation, and Supply Chain. I am currently working as a CX Analyst Intern for the City of San Diego to help them improve customer relations, and I think it's amazing to be able to apply what I've learned here at UC San Diego to the real world. In my free time, I like traveling, hanging out with my family/friends, and playing video games.
